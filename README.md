# Compiler Project

The Compiler Project is a software endeavor focused on the development of a robust compiler system. This compiler takes C code as its input and undergoes a series of meticulously designed steps to translate it into assembly language. The compiler plays a vital role in bridging the gap between human-readable high-level C code and machine-readable assembly language, which can be directly executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU).

## What is a Compiler?

A compiler is a fundamental tool in computer science and software development. It serves as an intermediary that simplifies the process of converting complex, human-readable code written in high-level programming languages (like C) into lower-level assembly language or machine code. The compilation process involves multiple stages, including lexical analysis (breaking the source code into tokens), parsing (constructing a hierarchical representation of the code's structure), semantic analysis (ensuring correctness and resolving variable references), code generation (producing target machine code), and optimization (improving code efficiency).

In essence, the Compiler Project is an ambitious effort to design and implement a compiler system that translates C code into assembly language, allowing programmers to write code in a high-level language while ensuring it can be executed efficiently by a computer. It represents a critical component in the software development process and promotes best practices in software development and code integrity.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Compiler Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Load the ant files into your Java directory.
3. Run the appropriate Main file, it provides the instructions.

## Features

- **C Code to Assembly**: Translate C code into assembly language.
- **Multi-Stage Compilation**: Implement multiple compilation stages, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization.
- **Robust Testing**: Develop a comprehensive test suite to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the compiler.
- **Code Integrity**: Promote code integrity and adherence to best practices in software development.

## Usage

You can use this project to translate C code into machine-runnable assembly but you're better off using something like GCC because this implementation doesn't go into optimizations like loop combining and therefore wouldn't produce the most efficient code. This project was a great way to learn about the inner workings of a compiler and gain a deeper understanding of computer systems as a whole.

## Contributions

This was a school project, therefore I am not looking for contributions.
